# Term Paper

Please read the following guidelines for the term paper: 

* The term paper is to be submitted by teams of 2 students. Send your term paper (`.ipynb`) to <mattes@dice.hhu.de>; **Subject: "MW122 Term Paper"**

* The submission deadline is **January 27, 16:00**. 

* Each group is required to submit an independent solution and collaboration between groups is not allowed.

* In case you donâ€™t have a student group yet, we have prepared this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JM0eBFDnNVuTV2hAn3TnNTyhOVkRTTj5cCwxTJTZF8k/edit?gid=0#gid=0). Here, you can insert your name and email address so that another student who is also looking for a group partner can contact you.

* The title page of the term paper must contain the names and student numbers of **all** students of the group.

* The paper should include the *replicable* and *self-explanatory* code and a readable documentation of your work. The documentation answers the (statistical) question in the exercise, explains the code and sums up your results in text form. Please provide concise and well thought-out answers and explanations. You can use in-line comments to explain what you do in a specific block of code.

* You may answer all questions either in German or in English.

* Try to solve as many exercises of the assignment as possible, even if you can't solve the exercise entirely. Try your best to get as far as you can.


* Among others, the final grade for your term paper will also depend on
    * Correctness and quality of the code,
    * Layout and Organization,
    * Quality of presentation of results (e.g. generating nice tables and figures),
    * Conciseness and quality of your answers and explanations.
