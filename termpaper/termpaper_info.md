# Assignment (Term Paper)

We will upload the assignment on **January 6**.\
The submission deadline is **January 27, 18:00**.


*Please read the following guidelines for the term paper:*

**Submission**
- The term paper is to be submitted by teams of up to 4 students. Send your term paper (PDF) and Python Code (PY or IPYNB) to **XXX**; Subject: “Term Paper Statistical Programming”

**Groups**
- Each group is required to submit an independent solution and collaboration between groups is not allowed.
- In case you don’t have a student group yet, send me an email. I will share a list with everybody who is looking for fellows.


**Paper and Code**
- The title page of the term paper must contain the names and matriculation numbers of all students of the group.
- The paper should include the replicable and self-explanatory code and a readable documentation of your work. The documentation answers the (statistical) question in the exercise, explains the code and sums up your results in text form. Please provide concise and well thought-out answers and explanations. You can use in-line comments to explain what you do in a specific block of code.
- You may answer all questions either in German or in English. You can choose the software for the documentation by yourselves (Jupyter, Quarto, Word, LateX…). We recommend you to use Quarto or Jupyter.
- Try to solve as many exercises of the assignment as possible, even if you can’t solve the exercise entirely.
- You are allowed to use ChatGPT and other tools. You are required to provide a paragraph where you describe how ChatGPT helped you and also provide a short critical reflection.

**Grading**
- Among others, the final grade for your term paper will also depend on
    - Correctness and quality of the code,
    - Layout and Organization,
    - Quality of presentation of results (e.g. generating nice tables and figures),
    - Conciseness and quality of your answers and explanations.
